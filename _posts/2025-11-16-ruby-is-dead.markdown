## Is Ruby on Rails dead?
If Ruby on Rails is dead or dying, it's not a quick death. There are currently 507,082 live sites using rails according to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/framework/Ruby-on-Rails). Now that is less than its peak of around 810,000 in 2020 but it's not exactly asking to be put out of it's misery.

Github, Shopify, AirBnB and Zendesk are just a small number of major companies using Ruby on Rails in their products, one of the main reasons I hear from people of why they are moving away from or don't want to use Ruby on Rails is performance. Now if your application is getting to the size of Shopify then sure we can talk about performance and alternatives but that is not the case for almost everybody else. Even so there are more important things to consider that are not performance and one of those is productivity. 

And it's not just legacy applications. As a freelancer, most of my work is for startups, and there are new projects starting in Rails all the time. In my opinion, even today, if you're starting a new web app—unless there are specific circumstances—Ruby on Rails is still the best option you can choose.

## Ruby on Rails lives on

And you guessed it, as I'm a Ruby on Rails dev, I hate anything to do with React. Far from it. React has its time and place, but unless you're creating a complicated, JS-heavy front end from the start, there's no need to use React. Ruby on Rails with Hotwire solves the majority of front-end situations you'll come across in normal web app development. If you find you need more than what Hotwire can offer, then you can render a React component inside a Rails partial—no problem—and give yourself that extra power. I think people run too fast to get React into their applications without needing the advantages it's there to provide. React comes with extra complications and maintenance, and if you don't really need it, you're taking on more responsibility for negligible gain.

Ruby is getting better and better
